DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest distance between 2 vertices.

1. Start with a weighted graph
2. Choose a starting vertex and assign infinity path values to all other vertices
3. Go to each vertex adjacent to this vertex and update its path length
4. If the path length of the adjacent vertex is lesser than the new path length, do not update it
5. Avoid updating path lengths of already visited vertices
6. After each iteration,  choose the unvisited vertex with the least path length
7. Repeat until all vertices have been visited

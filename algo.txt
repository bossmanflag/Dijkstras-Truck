DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM

 
Dijkstra's algorithm, published in 1959, is named after its discoverer Edsger Dijkstra, who was a Dutch computer scientist. This algorithm aims to find the shortest-path in a directed or undirected graph with non-negative edge weights.

Step 1: Set dist[s]=0, S=ϕ // s is the source vertex and S is a 1-D array having all the visited vertices

Step 2: For all nodes v except s, set dist[v]= ∞

Step 3: find q not in S such that dist[q] is minimum // vertex q should not be visited

Step 4: add q to S // add vertex q to S since it has now been visited

Step 5: update dist[r] for all r adjacent to q such that r is not in S //vertex r should not be visited dist[r]=min(dist[r], dist[q]+cost[q][r]) //Greedy and Dynamic approach

Step 6: Repeat Steps 3 to 5 until all the nodes are in S // repeat till all the vertices have been visited

Step 7: Print array dist having shortest path from the source vertex u to all other vertices

Step 8: Exit
